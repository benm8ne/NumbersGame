# NumbersGame
Random Number generator game that has 4 difficulty levels. The difficulty level correlates with the numbers you must guess. A hint system has been implemented to guide the user in making the correct guess. The hint system looks like (X, Y). X = # numbers correct within the guess. Y = # numbers inputted are in the correct position. So if level 3 is selected, the program generates (7, 9, 1). If the user inputs (3, 5, 8), they will reciece a hint of (0, 0) because no inputted integers are in the array. If the user inputes (9, 1, 3), they will recieve a hint of (2, 0) because there are 2 numbers within the arraylist, but not in the correct position. If the user inputs (7, 9, 2), they will recieve a hint of (2, 2) because there are 2 numbers within the arraylist as well as being in the correct position. Once all the numbers are correctly inputted in their correct positions, the user will be congratulated, and asked to play another game if they wish to do so.
